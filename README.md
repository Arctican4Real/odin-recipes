#Odin-Recipes
First project on "The odin project" course

Just finished the project, I have been working on this for the entire day!
To be honest, it took a lot longer than expected, but I'm happy with the results!
I can't wait to learn some CSS so I can make this look way better.
I also think I need to spend some time learning VScode shortcuts so I can get tasks done quicker.
This has been fun, and so far I am really enjoying it.

Ok so I learned some CSS and modified the pages, it isn't the prettiest thing in the world but for a first try in ages I am very happy with how it turned out.
A lot of the things I wanted to do (ie. Center divs and imgs, add cool effects, change list style etc.) I could not, so I had to go to stackoverflow for that.
I can't wait to learn more and make a lot more professional websites, so I am very excited!
I think I will log off for now, I've been working on this for around 2 hours...
