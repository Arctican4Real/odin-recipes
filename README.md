#Odin-Recipes
First project on "The odin project" course

Just finished the project, I have been working on this for the entire day!
To be honest, it took a lot longer than expected, but I'm happy with the results!
I can't wait to learn some CSS so I can make this look way better.
I also think I need to spend some time learning VScode shortcuts so I can get tasks done quicker.
This has been fun, and so far I am really enjoying it.
