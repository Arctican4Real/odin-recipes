        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This key lime pie recipe is made with condensed milk and sour cream. 
            Fabulously easy... A summertime favorite!
             If you have time, a homemade graham cracker crust is better! 
            Garnish with whipped cream and thin slices of lime if you like.      
        </p>
        <p>
            This pie is always well received whenever served. 
            It is light and refreshing and very attractive, too. An all-time favorite!
            You may substitute the key lime juice with a mixture of 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice and 1/4 cup fresh lime juice.

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix graham cracker crumbs with sugar and melted butter.
                Press into 9 inch pie plate and bake for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Separate 2 of the eggs, placing the two egg whites into a mixing bowl. Reserve the yolks in another bowl.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                To the yolks, add one whole egg, lime juice and sweetened condensed milk.
                Whisk until smooth. 
                With clean mixer blades or a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites with salt and cream of tartar until stiff, but not dry.
                Fold whites into filling mixture. Pour filling into partially baked crust.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 10 to 15 minutes or until set.
                Let cool at room temperature, then freeze 4 hours to overnight.
                Just before serving, whip cream to form stiff peaks.
                Serve decorated with whipped cream and lime slices.
